    <string name="tv_3">Here we have three TextViews: textView1 and textView2 on the left; and textView3 on the right. textView3 has been constrained to the end of textView1 and this works perfectly â€” it positions and sizes textView3 exactly as we need it.  However, things become more complicated if we need to support multiple languages. If we add a German translation then we have a problem because in the English version the text in textView1 is longer than that in textView2, whereas in German the text in textView2 is longer than that in textView1:</string>
